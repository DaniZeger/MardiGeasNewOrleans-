        <p>
          LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
          politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7,
          2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
          Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
          Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to
          hold the position in the city's history. Once in office, she
          established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
          creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city.
          Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
          finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate
          hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
          focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure,
          public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
          initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
          against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell
          negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and
          city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million
          in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26
          million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the
          approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of
          the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the
          2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a
          tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of a
          Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.

        <h2 class="titel">Naw Orleans Mardi gras</h2>
        <p>
          The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
          the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
          weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
          (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there
          is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have
          several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
          place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
          many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
          including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The
          parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes;
          most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
          earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
          earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
          modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
          events (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of
          Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
          Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
          traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are
          strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
          cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the
          same parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center
          their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
          originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
          along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
          French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and
          Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and
          French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras
          day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between
          Rex and Comus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at
          the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines
          Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
          men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The
          date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
          unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music
          and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt |
          A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of
          Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
          masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes
          prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions
          were lifted or enforcement waned.

          The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are
          purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in
          proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
          inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
          banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were
          chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely
          on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.[37][38]
          Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex
          Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on
          heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
          Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their
          "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was
          already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided.
          Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
          order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals
          (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
          that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[37] Following
          a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and
          gold-colored floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization
          retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
          justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly
          addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this
          order technically violates the rule of tincture
